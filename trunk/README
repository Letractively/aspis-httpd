Aspis is a lightweight http server, a fork of the high performance Boa
server. 

Boa was created in 1991 by Paul Phillips <paulp@go2net.com>.  It was later
maintained and enhanced by Larry Doolittle <ldoolitt@boa.org>
and Jon Nelson <jnelson@boa.org>.

For more information (including installation instructions) look at
